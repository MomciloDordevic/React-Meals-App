Welcome to my React-Meals Application!


The goal of this project was to educate and inform myself on how certain parts of a React App work.
Its a simple React app using Dummy Input and Values in order to simulate certain parts of a real world React Food Ordering application.


The application consists of a single page where we have a Header component, Meals display and a Cart for ordering.
The page consists of a Header component for navigation, a place where users can register by entering an Email Adress and a Password,
and a card where we can see and order dummy meals with fixed prices.


We have a module that pops up after clicking on the Cart button in the header, it displays the Name, Amount and Price of certain Items from the list.
We are also able to add and subtract certain meals in the Pop up module.

I have learned a lot on how to properly pass props and more on how useState works as a key concept in React.
